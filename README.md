# Movie-Manager
Project made for the course "Web System Information" at University.

This is an archive where an user can find information about film and artist (actors/director) and he could write a review and give a rating of every movie.
There is also a part where an admin could update the archive (like insert/delete new movie or new artist).

This project is entirely developed in Java with Springboot and Thymeleaf.
I used to store all the data PostgreSQL.

It include the frontend (html + css) and backend (Java).
